#  BugHub - Ethical Hacking & Bug Bounty Platform

##  The Idea of the Project
BugHub is a full-stack bug bounty platform designed to connect ethical hackers (researchers) with companies seeking to improve their cybersecurity. It provides a secure environment for researchers to submit vulnerability reports and for companies to review and respond to those reports. The platform features role-based dashboards and intuitive workflows for efficient report handling.

##  The Features
- Role-based authentication: Researchers, Companies, and Admins
- Researchers can:
  - Submit and track bug reports
  - Communicate via comments
- Companies can:
  - View and manage submitted reports
  - Accept, reject, or update report statuses
  - Collaborate with researchers through comments
- Admins can:
  - View all reports and users
  - Ban users and approve company registrations
- Clean, responsive UI using Bootstrap
- Secure user authentication system
- Structured backend using Django framework
